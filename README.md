# Currency Converter Program

This Python program allows users to convert currencies between **Rupiah**, **Dollar**, **Euro**, **Yen**, and **Pound**. Additionally, it features a **random** mode that automatically selects a currency for conversion. The program also supports continuous conversions, allowing users to perform multiple conversions in one session.

## Features

1. **Multiple Currency Options**: Supports conversions between Rupiah, Dollar, Euro, Yen, and Pound.
2. **Random Mode**: Users can choose "random" to have the program pick a currency at random for conversion.
3. **Formatted Output**: The output is formatted with commas for easier readability (e.g., `1,000,000`).
4. **Loop for Repeated Conversion**: After each conversion, the program asks if the user would like to convert again.

## Usage

1. The program asks the user which currency they want to convert. The user can choose:
    - `dollar`
    - `rupiah`
    - `euro`
    - `yen`
    - `pound`
    - `random` (to randomly choose a currency)
   
2. The program then prompts the user to enter the amount they wish to convert.

3. If the user chooses "rupiah", the program will display conversions to all the other currencies.

4. If the user chooses a specific currency (e.g., `dollar`, `euro`), the program converts the amount into Rupiah.

5. After completing a conversion, the program asks if the user wants to perform another conversion. If the user inputs `ya`, the program repeats. Otherwise, it ends.
